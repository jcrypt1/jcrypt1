# Hey, I'm Jarrett Vick 👋

**I build AI systems that build systems.**

30+ years in databases, systems engineering, and backend development — now focused on autonomous AI development platforms that automate the entire software lifecycle.

## 🔧 What I'm Building

### Agentic Server
An autonomous development platform that watches for tasks and dispatches AI agents to implement them — no human in the loop.

- **Trigger systems** — GitHub webhooks, Notion integration, polling
- **Full SDLC automation** — Plan → Build → Test → Review → Document → Ship
- **Parallel execution** — Git worktrees enable multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Self-improvement** — The platform creates issues for itself and implements fixes

### Genesis Project
Adaptive pattern intelligence system with multi-tier domain architecture designed for self-improvement and specialization. Built on Neo4j graph memory for long-term agent reasoning.

*Most of my active work lives in private repos. The green squares are real — the code just isn't public yet.*
